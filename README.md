# Handling Form

#### Handling user input and updating the state of a form 

In a form-based application, you might need to handle user input and update the state of the form as the user interacts with it.

You could use the useState hook to manage the state of the form inputs. 

You could use the useEffect hook to handle the side effect of updating the state when the user interacts with the form.

**Required Functionality:**

- Whenever user input's value, the value should be stored in a hook. 

- And with the change in value entered by user, console the input field's value.
